=========

Refine scattering data on the web!

You must re-make libcrysfml.so for each different machine.
Download pycrysfml from github/scattering and run "make deps"
then "make libcrysfml.so" to generate the file.

It is advised to use Wing IDE 4.0+ to code in Django.

Ext.js is not that intuitively obvious to code in. Remember 
that you can use the console in your web browser to set stop
points and debug your code. 

Note that hklGen.py is still being developed, and the version
here is not guaranteed to be the most updated version. Be sure
to git pull from the pycrysfml git directory.

A live version of WebRefine is available at tripleaxis.org as of
August 2, 2013.
