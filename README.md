Refine scattering data on the web!

You must re-make libcrysfml.so for each different machine.
Download pycrysfml from github/scattering and run "make deps"
then "make libcrysfml.so" to generate the file.

Note that hklGen.py is still being developed, and the version
here is not guaranteed to be the most updated version. Be sure
to git pull from the pycrysfml git directory.

A live version of WebRefine is available at tripleaxis.org as of
August 2, 2013.
